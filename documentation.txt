The program in question is currently broken, planning to fix during FEB sometime.

The basics of the program is that some csv file, in this case prices.csv is taken in through CLI,

Finally taken into insights, and based on some basic financial calculations like volatility the
program gives a rundown of what is going on with the stock.
